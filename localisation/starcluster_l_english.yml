  starcluster.4.name:0 "Abandoned Sector"
  starcluster.4.desc:0 "With a superficial scan of the stellar system [Root.GetStarName], one can quite accurately state that this system has long been a part of the empire of some ancient civilization. This is indicated by the many ruins of space structures. Moreover, this system seems to be only part of the stellar sector, the systems of which were connected to the network from the gates and highways."
  starcluster.5.name:0 "Starburst Region"
  starcluster.5.desc:0 "Upon entering the [Root.GetStarName] system, our astronomical observations indicate that we entered the region of star formation. Dense dust nebulae and an aggressive space environment in this star womb can adversely affect our ships."
  starcluster.6.name:0 "Hostile Cluster"
  starcluster.6.desc:0 "We register in the system the characteristic activity of many objects. The crew of the ship [ship.GetName] agrees that we have reached a very dangerous region of space."
  starcluster.7.name:0 "Closed Area"
  starcluster.7.desc:0 "Immediately upon entering the [Root.GetStarName] system, the crew of the ship [ship.GetName] received many identical signals. Deciphering the signal was practically not difficult, it represents an categorical demand - «Leave the protected area immediately!» The many fragments of the most diverse ships in this star system eloquently indicate that this is not just a warning."
  starcluster.8.name:0 "Storm Region"
  starcluster.8.desc:0 "After an initial inspection of the [Root.GetStarName] system and reconciliation of astronomical observations, the crew of the ship [ship.GetName] came to the conclusion that this region of space with is a region of storms. All the luminaries of this region of space are extremely unstable and are at the final stage of their evolution. These systems can be very dangerous for our ships."
  starcluster.9.name:0 "Dead Zone"
  starcluster.9.desc:0 "The devices of the ship [Root.GetStarName], upon entering the [Root.GetStarName] system, record very weak solar activity and radiation disturbances characteristic of stellar remnants in this area. It seems to be a region of dead stars that are in different stages of dying luminaries."
